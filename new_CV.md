Stable hydrogen isotope ratio ($\delta$D) approaches to understanding animal movement can  achieve good latitudinal resolution. However, assignments often still have limited utility because broad longitudinal regions share similar $\delta$D of precipitation. Incorporating other sources of information may mitigate many limitations of isotope-based assignments. We developed a Bayesian framework to refine isotopic estimates of migrant animal origins conditional on species distribution models informed by thousands of observations recorded by citizen-scientists. To illustrate the utility of this approach, we analyzed the migratory connectivity of the Virginia rail (Rallus limicola), a secretive and declining migratory wetland game bird in North America. 
Incorporating species distribution models compensated for the ecological naïveté of ??D models, resulting in relatively high-resolution, narrow assignments. Combined analysis of $\delta$D and species distribution models predicted that most Virginia rails wintering across five Gulf Coast sites spent the previous summer around the Great Lakes or Chesapeake Bay watershed. Conversely, the majority of migrating Virginia rails from a site in the Great Lakes most likely spent the previous winter on the Gulf Coast between Texas and Louisiana. Virginia rail seasonal connectivity does not fully correspond to the administrative flyways used to manage migratory birds, which were delineated based on data from unrelated but more conspicuous species. Our approach utilizes widely available, crowd-sourced data to improve our understanding of the movements of migratory animals.
